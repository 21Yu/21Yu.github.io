## Why I Chose MIT License

The **MIT License** is one of the most permissive and widely used open-source licenses in the software development community. Here’s why I chose it for this project:

- **Simplicity**: The MIT License is straightforward and easy to understand. It doesn't impose too many restrictions, allowing developers to freely use, modify, and distribute the code.
- **Encourages Collaboration**: By allowing others to freely use and contribute to the project, I aim to foster an open-source community around the portfolio project, where others can improve, suggest changes, or integrate this project into their own works.
- **Wide Adoption**: Many developers, especially beginners, are familiar with the MIT License. It’s a trusted and commonly accepted license, meaning people are more likely to use the project or contribute to it if it's MIT-licensed.
